# DEPRECATION WARNING!!!!
Since I've rewritten this project in rust as [locast2tuner](http://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2tuner), this project should be considered deprecated.

# locast2dvr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr)

This application provides an interface between locast.org and [Plex Media Server (PMS)](https://plex.tv) or [Emby](https://emby.media) by acting like a [HDHomerun](https://www.silicondust.com/) or an m3u Tuner and an XMLTV provider.

`locast2dvr` can imitate one or more digital tuners and provides geo cloaking across regions.

`locast2dvr` is a rewrite of [locast2plex](https://github.com/tgorgdotcom/locast2plex). Thanks to the locast2plex developers for writing it and figuring out how to stitch things together!

I rewrote locast2plex to be able to more easily add functionality, use libraries wherever possible (like HTTP, m3u, starting multiple devices, etc), heavily document, generally write clean code and provide a better user experience (command line argument parsing, automatic download of FCC facilities, etc).

Even though this project started as a locast to PMS interface, it's more focused on integrating locast with Emby, since Emby provides a bit more functionality when it comes to Live TV and Tuner (like m3u tuners, XMLTV, etc).

## Features
- Override your location using zipcode or GPS coordinates
- Multiple digital tuners in a single server, either as separate servers or as one (multiplexing)
- SSDP for easy discovery of Tuner devices in PMS or Emby
- Acts like either a HDHomerun Tuner or m3u tuner
- Provides locast EPG information as an XMLTV guide

## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.6
- An active locast.org account with an active donation. Locast doesn't allow you to stream without a donation.
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and available on your `$PATH`.


## Install (global python installation)
```sh
$ pip install locast2dvr
```

## Install (venv)
Imho, it's good practice to use a virtual environment when running python applications:
```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install locast2dvr
```

## Upgrade
```sh
$ pip install --upgrade locast2dvr
```

```

## Configuration
`locast2dvr` parameters can be specified as either command line arguments or in a configuration file that can be specified using that `--config` argument. Note that all configuration parameters need to use an underscore `_` instead of a hyphen `-` when used in a configuration file.


### Location overrides

By default `locast2dvr` uses your IP address to determine your location, but it also allows you to override the locast.org location you're creating a Tuner for. There are 3 mutually exclusive options:

- `override-location`, which takes a `<latitude>,<longitude>` argument. E.g. `--override-location 40.7128,-74.0060` for New York.
- `override-zipcodes`, which takes a comma separated list of zipcodes as an argument. E.g. `--override-zipcodes 90210,55111` for Los Angeles and Minneapolis.

### <a name="multi_region"></a>Multi regions

`locast2dvr` allows starting multiple instances. This is done using the `override-zipcodes` option. A [file with all available locast regions](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr/blob/main/regions) is included in the `locast2dvr` distribution.

When using multiple regions, `locast2dvr` will start multiple instances on TCP ports starting at the value that is specified with the `port` (or the default `6077`) argument and incremented by one. Also, the UUID of each device will be appended with `_x`, where `x` is incremented by one for each instance.

Note: PMS supports multiple devices, but does not support multiple Electronic Programming Guides (EPGs). Emby does support both. I personally use Emby since it allows for multiple EPGs.

### Usage in PMS or Emby

#### Tuners
`locast2dvr` can act as both a HDHomerun device or as an m3u tuner. Plex mainly supports HDHomerun, while Emby supports both. In case `locast2dvr` is used as an HDHomerun device it will use `ffmpeg` to copy the `mpegts` stream from locast to the Media server. When using `locast2dvr` as an m3u tuner, it will pass on the m3u from locast to the media server without any decoding.

- For use as a HDHomerun tuner, use `IP:PORT` (defaults to `127.0.0.1:6077`) to connect
- For use as an m3u tuner, use `http://IP:PORT/lineup.m3u` (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:6077/lineup.m3u`) as the URL to connect.

#### EPG
`locast2dvr` also provides Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) information from locast. This is served in [XMLTV](http://wiki.xmltv.org/) format. Emby has support for XMLTV and can be used by adding `http://IP:PORT/epg.xml`  (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:6077/epg.xml`) as an XMLTV TV Guide Data Provider.

### Multiplexing

`locast2dvr` normally starts an HTTP instance for each Tuner, starting at `port` (default `6077`). But with the option `--multiplex`, it will start a single HTTP interface multiplexing all Tuners through one interface for both streaming and EPG. Any channels that have the same call sign (like 4.1 ABC) will be deduped.

For example: if you use `--multiplex --override-zipcodes=90210,55111`, all channels from both zipcodes will be available, but multiplexed at `localhost:6077`.

In case you still want all HTTP interfaces to start besides the multiplexer, `--multiplex-debug` can be used. This will start the multiplexer the next port after the last Tuner.

For example: if you use `--multiplex --override-zipcodes=90210,55111` it will normally start HTTP interfaces on `127.0.0.1:6077` and `127.0.0.1:6078`. The multiplexer will be started on `127.0.0.1:6079`.

Note: This type of multiplexing makes sense in Emby, since you can add a single tuner at `http://PORT:IP` or `http://PORT:IP/lineup.m3u` and a single EPG at `http://PORT:IP/epg.xml`

## Running locast as a service
With the lack of Linux distro or MacOS packaging, [this wrapper script](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr/blob/main/tools/locast2dvr_wrapper.sh) can be used to start `locast2dvr` as a service using `systemd`.

Poor man's daemon:
- Copy the [wrapper script](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr/blob/main/tools/locast2dvr_wrapper.sh) to where ever you want locast to reside (e.g. `$HOME/.local/bin/locast2dvr_wrapper.sh`)
- Make it executable (`chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/locast2dvr_wrapper.sh`)
- Create a config file (e.g. `$HOME/.config/locast2dvr/config`)
- Copy [locast2dvr.service](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr/blob/main/tools/locast2dvr.service) to `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/locast2dvr.service` and make sure the paths specified in the file are correct.
- Run `systemctl --user start locast2dvr.service` to start the service
- Check `/var/log/syslog` if `locast2dvr` is running.

Note that the wrapper script will create a python `venv` and install `locast2dvr` in that virtual environment if the `venv` does not exist.

In order to enable `locast2dvr` at startup, run `systemctl --user enable locast2dvr.service`

Upgrading this installation of locast2dvr can be done by:
- `cd $HOME/.local/bin`
- `. ./locast2dvr-venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install locast2dvr --upgrade`

## Development
- Clone this repo
- Create a virtual env and activate it `python -m venv venv && . ./venv/bin/activate`
- Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install locast2dvr as editable `pip install --editable .`

You should now be able to develop and test your changes by running `$ locast2dvr`

### Testing
Before creating a PR, make sure all tests pass by running `pytest`.
